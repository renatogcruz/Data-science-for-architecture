    "\n",
    "As IfcSpace inherits from [IfcRoot](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC2x3/TC1/html/ifckernel/lexical/ifcroot.htm) it has direct attributes of Name, Description, GlobalID and as it is aslo a [IfcSpatialStructureElement](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC2x3/TC1/html/ifcproductextension/lexical/ifcspatialstructureelement.htm) it also has the attribute of LongName. \n",

While we wait for RhinoCode in Grasshopper.....

I had a chance to look into a live link between Grasshopper and a python script in Jupyter using Hops. Luckily I could copy-paste most of this example straight from RhinoCompute's Github. This kind of workflow can enable us to use the whole array of python packages on our data!

Example:
1) Open finite element model using BHoM and extract results
2) Perform necessary spatial modification, filtering and linking operations in grasshopper
3) Send data to python for visualisation using packages such as seaborn. Maybe we can use SciKit Learn to determine clusters and patterns in our data.

Looking forward to expanding this little example to do something useful!

The link seems to have a little bit of instability - the data is not sent to the app as consistently as I want it to. Anyone has experience with a similar link who can help me figure out why?

Also, any ideas for how a workflow like this can be utilised?
